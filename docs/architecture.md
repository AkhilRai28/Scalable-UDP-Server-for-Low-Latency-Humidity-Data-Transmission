# Architecture Overview

This repository implements a UDP server that processes sensor readings (humidity and temperature) and returns the data in real time. The system is designed with a modular approach:

1. **Sensor Module:**  
   Reads physical sensor data or, if enabled, simulates data.
   
2. **UDP Server:**  
   Manages incoming requests and returns formatted sensor data.

3. **Utility Modules:**  
   Includes custom logging, decorators, exception handling, and data formatting for enhanced modularity and maintenance.

4. **Service Layer:**  
   Provides additional functionalities such as analytics, notifications, caching, and metrics reporting.

5. **CI/CD Pipelines:**  
   Automated workflows for testing, linting, and deployment are integrated.

6. **Docker & Deployment:**  
   Docker configuration files enable containerized deployment with scalability in mind.

This design ensures robustness, ease of extension, and suitability for demanding production environments.
