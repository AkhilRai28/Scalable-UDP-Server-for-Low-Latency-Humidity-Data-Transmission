# Design Decisions

## Modular Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns:** The code is segmented into sensor handling, network server implementation, utility functions, and additional services.
- **Reusability:** The services layer enables integration with external systems for analytics, notifications, and caching.

## Robust Error Handling
- **Retry Mechanisms:** The sensor reading module implements retries to mitigate transient errors.
- **Custom Exceptions:** Specialized exceptions in `utils/exceptions.py` help pinpoint errors.

## Containerization and CI/CD
- **Docker Integration:** Enables consistent deployment across diverse environments.
- **GitHub Workflows:** Automated testing and linting ensure code quality is maintained.

## Logging and Monitoring
- **Advanced Logging:** Detailed log management facilitates debugging and monitoring.
- **Performance Metrics:** The services layer includes hooks for analytics and metrics, allowing real-time performance tracking.
